- Where can I find all the tokens supported by the Loopring protocol, and how can I get my ERC20 token listed on a Loopring DEX?
> We have a set of [dedicated documents](https://loopring.github.io/docs/deployment/) detailing the process of registering new ERC20 tokens with the Loopring Protocol, as well as adding new trading pairs to Loopring's official Bootstrap relay cluster and its [Loopr wallex](https://loopring.io) and [Circulr DEX](https://lcirculr.loopring.io).

- What's the usage of the LRC token?
> LRC will be used to pay wallexs/DEXs for order management and relayers as an order matching fee. Relayers typically have fiat expenses for paying their developers, cloud services, etc, and also must pay Ether to Ethereum miners to include trade settlement transactions into blocks. In the future, LRC will also be used by the community to effectively govern protocol updates.
