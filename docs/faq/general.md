- Can Loopring do cross-chain token trading?

> Loopring is blockchain agnostic, meaning it can facilitate the trading of tokens on any smart contract capable public blockchain. But Loopring is not a cross-chain protocol. In order to perform cross-chain trading, tokenization services have to get involved to help issue asset-backed tokens on the target blockchain.

- Loopring has issued LRC, LRN, and will probably issue LRQ. Will you issue a lot more LRx protocol tokens and will that dilute the value and lower the price of LRC?

> We have deployed Loopring on top of Ethereum and Qtum mainnet, and on NEO testnet. In order to make Loopring's matching-as-a-service work, there has to be a token for each target blockchain to incentivize different ecosystem roles.

> Going forward, we'll be even pickier in selecting target blockchains and will only deploy Loopring protocol on blockchains that have great potential and massive dApp adoptions. We are also working with select public blockchain teams to integrate Loopring directly into their native codebase to avoid issuing a new token.

> Issuing new LRx tokens, however, will not dilute the value of LRC or any other LRx tokens, as each LRx token is unique to its underlying blockchain and cannot be substituted by other LRx tokens. The value and price of an LRx token mostly depends on the value of its underlying blockchain ecosystem.

- When will LRC/LRN hit $XYZ?
> At Loopring, we refrain from talking about the price of our tokens in public. We are devoted to building robust decentralized trading infrastructure and believe value will naturally accrue to the ecosytem and token holders. We also pledge that we will not manipulate the price of our tokens.

- How do you protect yourselves from copycats?

> We have filed multiple patents globally (including the US, EU, China, etc.) and will submit more patents soon. We will leverage these patents to fight against copycats and other copyright/patent infringements to protect ourselves and the interest of our token holders.

> Specifically, integrating Loopring into public blockchain will require formal patent authentication in writing from the Loopring Foundation.

- What are the differences between Loopring, 0x, and Kyber?
            
> Loopring and 0x are protocols designed for order-based token trading, while Kyber is more of a market-making protocol. Both Loopring and 0x feature off-chain order-management and on-chain settlement with atomic token swaps. Loopring offers some unique features: 1) Loopring's Unidirectional Order Model doesn't differentiate takers and makers and makes its data modeling more generalized. 2) Loopring is designed with matching-as-a-service (MAAS) in mind, which lowers relayers' barriers to entry and enables traders to submit-and-forget their orders. 3) Loopring features ring-matching which provides better liquidity and optimized trading prices. 4) Loopring's patented anti front-running technology protects relayers' matching work from being intercepted. 5) Loopring Foundation offers more open-sourced software for potential ecosystem partners to adopt our solution with minimum cost. 6) We advocate for relayers to share liquidity by joining an order sharing mesh network instead of running isolated backends.

> 0x and Kyber are solid projects, and we believe the DEX market is big enough for all of us and even more protocols.
             
- Are you working with any centralized exchanges?
> We are not actively talking to centralized exchanges because they are not incentivized to adopt DEX solutions and what Loopring offers indeed conflicts with the way they make money.

> One of our objectives is to transform non-custodial wallets into DEXs. These wallets do not currently have obvious or feasible monetization mechanisms, thus our priority is to work with and empower wallets.
           
- Will you consider working with companies listed on stock exchanges?
           
> We are open to partnering with any organization globally as long as their involvement can accelerate the adoption of the Loopring Protocol, strengthen the ecosystem, and increase the demand for our LRx tokens.
            
- When will Loopring launch its own mainnet?
           
> Loopring is a 2nd layer protocol and thus does not have a mainnet to launch. We deploy on top of public, smart contract capable blockchains, and have thus far deployed Loopring on Ethereum and Qtum mainnets, and NEO testnet.
